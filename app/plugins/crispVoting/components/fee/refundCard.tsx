/**
 * Offered when a proposal's E3 round has died: the fee paid to Interfold is refundable, and the
 * plugin routes the claim back to the recorded fee payer's escrowed credit.
 *
 * Getting there takes up to three permissionless transactions, because Interfold does not fail or
 * settle a round on its own — see `useClaimRefund`. The card shows which of them are outstanding
 * rather than offering a single "Claim" that reverts with `RefundNotCalculated`.
 *
 * The action is shown to anyone: every step only ever moves funds to the recorded payer, so a
 * bystander running it is doing the payer a favour, not taking anything.
