/**
 * Claims the requester refund for a proposal whose E3 failed.
 *
 * Claiming is the LAST of three steps, and the first two are what make it work:
 *
 *   1. `markE3Failed(e3Id)` moves the round from its stalled stage into `Failed`. Interfold never
 *      does this itself — it is a permissionless call someone must send once a stage deadline
 *      passes, so a round whose DKG timed out days ago still reads as live until then.
 *   2. `processE3Failure(e3Id)` transfers the payment to the refund manager and calculates the
 *      distribution. Without it `claimRequesterRefund` reverts with `RefundNotCalculated`.
 *   3. `claimRefund(proposalId)` on the plugin, which credits the recorded `proposalPayer`.
 *
 * The plugin's `claimRefund` forwards straight to the refund manager with no preconditions of its
 * own, so offering step 3 alone reverts on any round that has not been through 1 and 2. This hook
 * runs whichever steps are still outstanding.
 *
 * Step 3 is permissionless by design — the refund manager only ever pays the requester (the
 * plugin), and the plugin credits the recorded payer — so the caller gains nothing by claiming on
 * someone else's behalf. Steps 1 and 2 are permissionless in Interfold for the same reason.
